Under the mentorship of [Dr. Jorge Galvez](http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g319/p8408285) at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, [Nicholas McGill](http://nmcgill.com) and I developed [Tracheal Aire](http://mriveralee.github.io/tracheal-aire), a web-based platform for creating customized Williams Intubating Airways based on patient MRI and CT scan data.


Our platform was built for the [Society of Technology in Anesthesia](http://www.stahq.org/) (STA) Engineering Challenge in 2014. Our interface supports the customization of two types of intubating airways and can export a finished product in four different 3D printable file types. The implementation is based on [OpenJSCAD](http://openjscad.org/'), an open source JavaScript-based Computer-aided Design software.
